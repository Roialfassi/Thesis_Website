## Goal of the Experiment
In this experiment we try to see if we can detect chatGPT written text on a topic using LPA.

We ran 11 on pok_mon where:

We have taken **6996** stories written by 6012 different writers on pok_mon.

We also took 2 chatGPT along side with the stories and tested to see whether the Distance from the DVR is significantly different.

## Results

### Distances
The average distance of the real fanfiction from the DVR is: **0.31**
The average distance of the poromts fanfiction from the DVR is: **0.42**
The median distance of the real fanfiction from the DVR is: **0.26**
The median distance of the poromts fanfiction from the DVR is: **0.44**
After running a t-test we we arrived at this conclusion at 95% certainty:
**There is no significant difference between the distances of the real and prompt datasets, or the mean distance of the real dataset is smaller than that of the prompt dataset.**

## F1
Our **average** f1 result was **0.00 **
Our **top** f1 result was **0.00 **
Our **worst** f1 result was **0.00**
Our **median** f1 result was **0.00**

## Threshold
Our **average** Threshold was **0.41 **
Our **highest** Threshold was **0.46 **
Our **lowest** Threshold was **0.24**
Our **median** Threshold was **0.44**

## Frequency
Our **average** frequency was **0.00 **
Our **highest** frequency was **0.00 **
Our **lowest** frequency was **0.00**
Our **median** frequency was **0.00**

## Recall
Our **average** Recall was **0.90 **
Our **highest** Recall was **1.00 **
Our **lowest** Recall was **0.50**
Our **median** Recall was **1.00**
